# ensureDir(dir, [callback])

Ensures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created. Like `mkdir -p`.

**Aliases:** `mkdirs()`, `mkdirp()`

- `dir` `<String>`
- `callback` `<Function>`

## Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const dir = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist'
fs.ensureDir(dir, err => {
  console.log(err) // => null
  // dir has now been created, including the directory it is to be placed in
})

// With Promises:
fs.ensureDir(dir)
.then(() => {
  console.log('success!')
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error(err)
})
```
